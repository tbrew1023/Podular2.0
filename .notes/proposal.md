Dear Jasna,
Thank you for the opportunity to work with you on this project. There's a lot of talent out there, so I'm grateful that you decided to reach out and collaborate on Podular 2.0. It's so exciting that the product is beginning manufacturing and that you're ready to launch the online store. I'm looking forward to working with you over these next few months to make this a success.

## 1.2. Overview

This proposal outlines the scope of work for the overhaul of Podular's marketing website. Throughout this document I will refer to the newly designed website as Podular 2.0. It includes the project timeline, deliverables, and features. It also includes the tools and technologies that will be used to build the product. The proposal is broken down into the following sections: Background, Objectives, Tools and Technologies, Scope of Work, Timeline, Terms and Conditions, and Next Steps.

# 2. BACKGROUND

## 2.1. Problem

Podular's current website is outdated and does not propoerly reflect the brand, the product or the company's current offerings. The website is not optimized for mobile devices, it lacks CRM integration which makes it difficult to track user behavior and to send targeted marketing campaigns, it does not have an online store, and it suffers from subpar performance and security.

## 2.2. Solution

Podular 2.0 will be a complete overhaul of the current website. It will be built from the ground up using the latest technologies and best practices. The site will be optimized for performance and security, it will be integrated with a CRM, and it will have an online store. The site will be designed mobile-first, and built using a headless CMS which will allow the company to easily manage content and products.
